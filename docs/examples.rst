Tenant Tutorial
---------------
This app comes with an interactive tutorial to teach you how to use ``django-tenants`` and to demonstrate its capabilities. This example project is available under `examples/tenant_tutorial <https://github.com/bernardopires/django-tenant-schemas/blob/master/examples/tenant_tutorial>`_. You will only need to edit the ``settings.py`` file to configure the ``DATABASES`` variable and then you're ready to run

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py runserver
